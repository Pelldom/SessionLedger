# LICENSE instructions (Apache-2.0)

This starter pack includes the project specs and implementation staging outputs.
To keep the license text canonical (and avoid accidental transcription errors), add the official Apache 2.0 license text verbatim.

1) Create a file at repo root named: LICENSE
2) Paste the canonical text from:
   https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt

Optional:
- Add a NOTICE file if you want additional attribution text (not required for most app projects).
